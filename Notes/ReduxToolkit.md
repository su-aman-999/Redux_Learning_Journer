# Redux Toolkit

## Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux
Add the Redux Toolkit and React-Redux packages to your project:

`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux `

## Create a Redux Store
Create a file named `src/app/store.js`. Import the `configureStore` API from Redux Toolkit. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it:
```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})
```
This creates a Redux store, and also automatically configure the Redux DevTools extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

## Provide the Redux Store to React
Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React-Redux `<Provider>` around our application in `src/index.js`. Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider>` around your `<App>`, and pass the store as a prop:
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import { store } from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

const container = document.getElementById('root')

if (container) {
  const root = createRoot(container)

  root.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>,
  )
} else {
  throw new Error(
    "Root element with ID 'root' was not found in the document. Ensure there is a corresponding HTML element with the ID 'root' in your HTML file.",
  )
}
```

## Create a Redux State Slice
Add a new file `named src/features/counter/counterSlice.js`. In that file, import the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit.

Creating a slice requires a string name to identify the slice, an initial state value, and one or more reducer functions to define how the state can be updated. Once a slice is created, we can export the generated Redux action creators and the reducer function for the whole slice.

Redux requires that ***we write all state updates immutably, by making copies of data and updating the copies***. However, Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` and `createReducer` APIs use ***Immer*** inside to allow us to ***write "mutating" update logic that becomes correct immutable updates***.

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

## Use Redux State and Actions in React Components
Now we can use the React-Redux hooks to let React components interact with the Redux store. We can read data from the store with `useSelector`, and dispatch actions using `useDispatch`. Create a `src/features/counter/Counter.js` file with a `<Counter>` component inside, then import that component into `App.js` and render it inside of `<App>`.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { decrement, increment } from './counterSlice'

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now, any time you click the "Increment" and "Decrement" buttons:

- The corresponding Redux action will be dispatched to the store
- The counter slice reducer will see the actions and update its state
- The`<Counter>` component will see the new state value from the store and re-render itself with the new data

## What You've Learned
That was a brief overview of how to set up and use Redux Toolkit with React. Recapping the details:
> - **Create a Redux store with `configureStore`**
>   - `configureStore` accepts a `reducer` function as a named argument
>   - `configureStore` automatically sets up the store with good default settings
> - **Provide the Redux store to the React application components**
>   - Put a React-Redux `<Provider>` component around your  `<App />`
>   - Pass the Redux store as `<Provider store={store}>`
> - **Create a Redux "slice" reducer with createSlice**
>   - Call `createSlice` with a string name, an initial state, and named reducer functions
>   - Reducer functions may "mutate" the state using Immer
>   - Export the generated slice reducer and action creators
> - **Use the React-Redux `useSelector/useDispatch` hooks in React components**
>   - Read data from the store with the `useSelector` hook
>   - Get the `dispatch` function with the `useDispatch` hook, and dispatch actions as needed
